This presentation is a website built using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), Markdown, [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (which is free!).

It [uses](https://github.com/AramZS/steal-the-internet) a technique called "*Static Site Generation*" to create a series of static HTML files that are very stable and inexpensive to host.
