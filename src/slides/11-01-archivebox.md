You can use ArchiveBox to archive groups of pages, whole sites, [sitemaps](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/overview) or [RSS feeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS). It also makes copies of videos with [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

You can also make a copy of the files it creates.

Or use it to [create a static website](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Publishing-Your-Archive#2-export-and-host-it-as-static-html) with all your archives.
